                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Dr. Kenneth David Kaunda, affectionately known as KK, was Zambia's first president and one of the last surviving leaders of Africa's independence generation. He led Zambia to independence from British rule in 1964 and served as president until 1991.</p>
                    
                    <p>Born on April 28, 1924, at Lubwa Mission in Chinsali, Kaunda was the youngest of eight children. His father was a Presbyterian missionary and teacher from Malawi, and his mother was one of Zambia's first African women teachers.</p>
                    
                    <p>What I admire most about Dr. Kaunda was his unwavering commitment to peace, his dedication to African unity, and his humble leadership style. Despite being a president, he maintained a simple lifestyle and was known for his trademark white handkerchief, which became his symbol.</p>
